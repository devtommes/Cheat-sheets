## Async and Await Guidelines

Read the [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) document](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=19957).
It is extremely well-written, and includes guidance on API design and the proper
use of async/await (including cancellation and progress reporting).

If you have any of these Old examples in your new async code, you're Doing It Wrong(TM):

| `Task` constructor | `Task.Run` or `TaskFactory.StartNew` | Create a code-based task                                      |

The async and await keywords have done a great job of simplifying writing asynchronous code in C#, but unfortunately they can't magically protect you from getting things wrong.  I want to highlight a bunch of the most common async coding mistakes or antipatterns that I've come across in code reviews.

Whenever you call a method that returns a Task or Task<T> you should not ignore its return value. In most cases, that means awaiting it, although there are occasions where you might keep hold of the Task to be awaited later.

In this example, we call Task.Delay but because we don't await it, the "After" message will get immediately written, because Task.Delay(1000) simply returns a task that will complete in one second, but nothing is waiting for that task to finish.

    Console.WriteLine("Before");
    Task.Delay(1000);
    Console.WriteLine("After");

f you make this mistake in a method that returns Task and is marked with the async keyword, then the compiler will give you a helpful error:
Because this call is not awaited, execution of the current method continues before the call is completed. 			Consider applying the 'await' operator to the result of the call.

But in synchronous methods or task-returning methods not marked as async it appears the C# compiler is quite happy to let you do this, so remain vigilant that you don't let this mistake go unnoticed.

**Ignoring tasks**
Sometimes developers will deliberately ignore the result of an asynchronous method because they explicitly don't want to wait for it to complete. Maybe it's a long-running operation that they want to happen in the background while they get on with other work. So sometimes I see code like this:

    var ignoredTask = DoSomethingAsync();

The danger with this approach is that nothing is going to catch any exceptions thrown by DoSomethingAsync. At best, that means you didn't know it failed to complete. At worst, it can terminate your process.

So use this approach with caution, and make sure the method has good exception handling. Often when I see code like this in cloud-applications, I often refactor it to post a message to a queue, whose message handler performs the background operation.

**Using async void methods**
Every now and then you'll find yourself in a synchronous method (i.e. one that doesn't return a Task or Task<T>) but you want to call an async method. However, without marking the method as async you can't use the await keyword. There are two ways developers work round this and both are risky.

The first is when you're in a void method, the C# compiler will allow you to add the async keyword. This allows us to use the await keyword:

    public async void MyMethod()
    {
        await DoSomethingAsync();
    }

The trouble is, that the caller of MyMethod has no way to await the outcome of this method. They have no access to the Task that DoSomethingAsync returned. So you're essentially ignoring a task again.

Now there are some valid use cases for async void methods. The best example would be in a Windows Forms or WPF application where you're in an event handler. Event handlers have a method signature that returns void so you can't make them return a Task.

So it's not necessarily a problem to see code like this:

    public async void OnButton1Clicked(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        await LoadDataAsync();
        // update UI
    }

But in most cases, I recommend against using async void. If you can make your method return a Task, you should do so.

**Blocking on tasks with .Result or .Wait**
Another common way that developers work around the difficulty of calling asynchronous methods from synchronous methods is by using the .Result property or .Wait method on the Task. The .Result property waits for a Task to complete, and then returns its result, which at first seems really useful. We can use it like this:

    public void SomeMethod()
    {
        var customer = GetCustomerByIdAsync(123).Result;
    }

But there are some problems here. The first is that using blocking calls like Result ties up a thread that could be doing other useful work. More seriously, mixing async code with calls to .Result (or .Wait()) opens the door to some really nasty deadlock problems.

Usually, whenever you need to call an asynchronous method, you should just make the method you are in asynchronous. Yes, its a bit of work and sometimes results in a lot of cascading changes which can be annoying in a large legacy codebase, but that is still usually preferable to the risk of introducing deadlocks.

There might be some instances in which you can't make the method asynchronous. For example, if you want to make an async call in a class constructor - that's not possible. But often with a bit of thought, you can redesign the class to not need this.

For example, instead of this:

    class CustomerHelper
    {
        private readonly Customer customer;
        public CustomerHelper(Guid customerId, ICustomerRepository customerRepository) 
        {
            customer = customerRepository.GetAsync(customerId).Result; // avoid!
        }
    }

You could do something like this, using an asynchronous factory method to build the class instead:

    class CustomerHelper
    {
        public static async Task<CustomerHelper> CreateAsync(Guid customerId, ICustomerRepository customerRepository)
        {
            var customer = await customerRepository.GetAsync(customerId);
            return new CustomerHelper(customer)
        }
    
	    private readonly Customer customer;
	    private CustomerHelper(Customer customer) 
	    {
	        this.customer = customer;
	    }
    }

Other situations where your hands are tied are when you are implementing a third party interface that is synchronous, and cannot be changed. I've ran into this with IDispose and implementing ASP.NET MVC's ActionFilterAttribute. In these situations you either have to get very creative, or just accept that you need to introduce a blocking call, and be prepared to write lots of ConfigureAwait(false) calls elsewhere to protect against deadlocks (more on that shortly).

The good news is that with modern C# development, it is becoming increasingly rare that you need to block on a task. Since C# 7.1 you could declare async Main methods for console apps, and ASP.NET Core is much more async friendly than the previous ASP.NET MVC was, meaning that you should rarely find yourself in this situation.

**Mixing ForEach with async methods**
The List<T> class has a "handy" method called ForEach that performs an Action<T> on every element in the list. If you've seen any of my LINQ talks you'll know my misgivings about this method as encourages a variety of bad practices (read this for some of the reasons to avoid ForEach). But one common threading-related misuse I see, is using ForEach to call an asynchronous method.

For example, let's say we want to email all customers like this:

    customers.ForEach(c => SendEmailAsync(c));

What's the problem here? Well, what we've done is exactly the same as if we'd written the following foreach loop:

    foreach(var c in customers)
    {
        SendEmailAsync(c); // the return task is ignored
    }

We've generated one Task per customer but haven't waited for any of them to complete.

Sometimes I'll see developers try to fix this by adding in async and await keywords to the lambda:

    customers.ForEach(async c => await SendEmailAsync(c));

But this makes no difference. The ForEach method accepts an Action<T>, which returns void. So you've essentially created an async void method, which of course was one of our previous antipatterns as the caller has no way of awaiting it.

So what's the fix to this? Well, personally I usually prefer to just replace this with the more explicit foreach loop:

    foreach(var c in customers)
    {
        await SendEmailAsync(c);
    }

Some people prefer to make this into an extension method, called something like ForEachAsync, which would allow you to write code that looks like this:

await customers.ForEachAsync(async c => await SendEmailAsync(c));
But don't mix List<T>.ForEach (or indeed Parallel.ForEach which has exactly the same problem) with asyncrhonous methods.

**Excessive parallelization**
Occasionally, a developer will identify a series of tasks that are performed sequentially as being a performance bottleneck. For example, here's some code that processes some orders sequentially:

    foreach(var o in orders)
    {
        await ProcessOrderAsync(o);
    }

Sometimes I'll see a developer attempt to speed this up with something like this:

    var tasks = orders.Select(o => ProcessOrderAsync(o)).ToList();
    await Task.WhenAll(tasks);

What we're doing here is calling the ProcessOrderAsync method for every order, and storing each resulting Task in a list. Then we wait for all the tasks to complete. Now, this does "work", but what if there were 10,000 orders? We've flooded the thread pool with thousands of tasks, potentially preventing other useful work from completing. If ProcessOrderAsync makes downstream calls to another service like a database or a microservice, we'll potentially overload that with too high a volume of calls.

What's the right approach here? Well at the very least we could consider constraining the number of concurrent threads that can be calling ProcessOrderAsync at a time. I've written about a few different ways to achieve that here.

If I see code like this in a distributed cloud application, it's often a sign that we should introducing some messaging so that the workload can be split into batches and handled by more than one server.

**Non-thread-safe side-effects**
If you've ever looked into functional programming (which I recommend you do even if you have no plans to switch language), you'll have come across the idea of "pure" functions. The idea of a "pure" function is that it has no side effects. It takes data in, and it returns data, but it doesn't mutate anything. Pure functions bring many benefits including inherent thread safety.

Often I see asynchronous methods like this, where we've been passed a list or dictionary and in the method we modify it:

    public async Task ProcessUserAsync(Guid id, List<User> users)
    {
        var user = await userRepository.GetAsync(id);
        // do other stuff with the user
        users.Add(user);
    }

The trouble is, this code is risky as it is not thread-safe for the users list to be modified on different threads at the same time. Here's the same method updated so that it no longer has side effects on the users list.

    public async Task<User> ProcessUserAsync(Guid id)
    {
        var user = await userRepository.GetAsync(id);
        // do other stuff with the user
        return user;
    }

Now we've moved the responsibility of adding the user into the list onto the caller of this method, who has a much better chance of ensuring that the list is accessed from one thread only.

**Missing ConfigureAwait(false)**
ConfigureAwait is not a particularly easy concept for new developers to understand, but it is an important one, and if you find yourself working on a codebase that uses .Result and .Wait it can be critical to use correctly.

I won't go into great detail, but essentially the meaning of ConfigureAwait(true) is that I would like my code to continue on the same "synchronization context" after the await has completed. For example, in a WPF application, the "synchronization context" is the UI thread, and I can only make updates to UI components from that thread. So I almost always want ConfigureAwait(true) in my UI code.

    private async void OnButtonClicked() 
    {
        var data = await File.ReadAllBytesAsync().ConfigureAwait(true);
        this.textBoxFileSize.Text = $"The file is ${data.Length} bytes long"; // needs to be on the UI thread
    }

Now ConfigureAwait(true) is actually the default, so we could safely leave it out of the above example and everything would still work.

But why might we want to use ConfigureAwait(false)? Well, for performance reasons. Not everything needs to run on the "synchronization context" and so its better if we don't make one thread do all the work. So ConfigureAwait(false) should be used whenever we don't care what thread the continuation runs on, which is actually a lot of the time, especially in low-level code that is dealing with files and network calls.

However, when we start combining code that has synchronization contexts, ConfigureAwait(false) and calls to .Result, there is a real danger of deadlocks. And so the recommended way to avoid this is to remember to call ConfigureAwait(false) everywhere that you don't explicitly need to stay on the synchronization context.

For example, if you make a general purpose NuGet library, then it is highly recommended to put ConfigureAwait(false) on every single await call, since you can't be sure of the context in which it will be used.

There is some good news on the horizon. In ASP.NET Core there is no longer a synchronization context, which means that you no longer need to put calls to ConfigureAwait(false) in. Although, it remains recommended when creating NuGet packages.

But if you are working on projects that run the risk of a deadlock, you need to be very vigilant about adding the ConfigureAwait(false) calls in everywhere.

**Ignoring the async version**
Whenever a method in the .NET framework takes some time, or performs some disk or network IO, there is almost always an asynchronous version of the method you can use instead. Unfortunately, the synchronous versions remain for backwards compatibility reasons. But there is no longer any good reason to use them.

So for example, prefer Task.Delay to Thread.Sleep, prefer dbContext.SaveChangesAsync to dbContext.SaveChanges and prefer fileStream.ReadAsync to fileStream.Read. These changes free up the thread-pool threads to do other more useful work, allowing your program to process a higher volume of requests.

**try catch without await**
There's a handy optimization that you might know about. Let's suppose we have a very simple async method that only makes a single async call as the last line of the method:

    public async Task SendUserLoggedInMessage(Guid userId)
    {
        var userLoggedInMessage = new UserLoggedInMessage() { UserId = userId };
        await messageSender.SendAsync("mytopic", userLoggedInMessage);
    }

In this situation, there is no need to use the async and await keywords. We could have simply done the following and returned the task directly:

    public Task SendUserLoggedInMessage(Guid userId)
    {
        var userLoggedInMessage = new UserLoggedInMessage() { UserId = userId };
        return messageSender.SendAsync("mytopic", userLoggedInMessage);
    }

Under the hood, this produces slightly more efficient code, as code using the await keyword compiles into a state machine behind the scenes.

But let's suppose we update the function to look like this:

    public Task SendUserLoggedInMessage(Guid userId)
    {
        var userLoggedInMessage = new UserLoggedInMessage() { UserId = userId };
        try
        {
            return messageSender.SendAsync("mytopic", userLoggedInMessage);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            logger.Error(ex, "Failed to send message");
            throw;
        }
    }

It looks safe, but actually the catch clause will not have the effect you might expect. It will not catch all exceptions that might be thrown while the Task returned from SendAsync runs. That's because we've only caught exceptions that were thrown while we created that Task. If we wanted to catch exceptions thrown at any point during that task, we need the await keyword again:

    public async Task SendUserLoggedInMessage(Guid userId)
    {
        var userLoggedInMessage = new UserLoggedInMessage() { UserId = userId };
        try
        {
            await messageSender.SendAsync("mytopic", userLoggedInMessage);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            logger.Error(ex, "Failed to send message");
            throw;
        }
    }

Now our catch block will be able to catch exceptions thrown at any point in the SendAsync task execution.
